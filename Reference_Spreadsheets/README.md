# ProjectAMP - Reference Files
Academic Management Program (Managing courses and resources)

The files included in this directory are examples of material utilizes to test or develop the needed functionality in the application. More than likely, they are the way that was developed that the application hopefully does in a much easier to manage way!

Files:

- Skillset-Registered-Demo.ods (Note, file has been sanitized and data randomized. The skill columns are a close approximation of actual courses, but names were replaced with randomly generated ones and notes were randomly filled in to demonstrate how it was utilized for planning.)
- UJA-Tech-Course-Catalog.ods (The actual course catalog from UJ for teach courses. Additional columns are just thoughts of trying to use to link to other spreadsheets, build in the date calculator, or other experiments. So just a reference point.)
  - *Experimented with adding additional functionality such as flagging a course for "update review" if it had been more than two years since the first run of a course.* 
- Date-Calculator.ods (The quick tool made to establish to-do's of deadlines for when various milestones should be accomplished. Issue contracts, get course into development, etc.
